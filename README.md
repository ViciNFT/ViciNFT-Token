# Vicinity Token

Participate in the rapid growth of ViciNFT Corporation and the communities it’s building. Launched a mere 15 months ago, the company has experienced tremendous success launching numerous communities by leveraging its proprietary technology platform. The ViciNFT platform provides a powerful tool suite that customizes and automates NFT creation, sales, and post-sales management. We are excited about the launch of our Zoom integration, which enables our partners to launch NFTs that connect directly with their communities without the need for user IDs and passwords.

Communities are the center of our universe and are the key to our success. NFTs and tokens can strengthen the relationship between consumers and their favorite brands. The consumer can connect directly to their favorite creators and brands by gaining access to special merchandise, events, and privileges, increasing brand loyalty and raising brand value. Ultimately, translating into the consumer spending more on brands’ products. The company’s already launched communities include Kathy Lee Gifford, Mamas and Papas’ Michelle Phillips, Aquarium of the Bay, Sam’s Anchor Café, Doug Vermeeren, and Servino’s.

We are now launching the ViciNFT Tokens. The ViciNFT Token is a utility token, which is designed for several purposes, but was specifically developed to be used with the ViciNFT communities. We believe the utility of ViciNFT Tokens will be broad and varied, and are complementary to the NFTs launched by our partners. In the future, the Tokens can be exchanged for access to special events, premium content and experiences, memberships, Non-Fungible Token (NFT) drops and sales, access to content creators, and physical products within the ViciNFT communities. As highlighted above, we are excited to launch our Zoom integration, which enables our partners to launch NFTs that connect directly with their communities without the need for user IDs and passwords. Our ViciNFT Token serves as fuel to increase the frequency and duration of the Zoom calls with their favorite personalities. As additional communities are added, we will expect demand for the ViciNFT Tokens to increase.
