# ViciCoin (VCNT)

ViciCoin (VCNT) is a utility token, designed to help communities flourish. We believe the utility of ViciCoin will be broad and continue to grow to support our partners.

Participate in the rapid growth of ViciNFT Corporation and the communities it’s building. Launched in May of 2021, the company has experienced tremendous success launching numerous communities by leveraging its proprietary technology platform. The ViciNFT platform provides a powerful tool suite that customizes and automates NFT creation, sales, and post-sales management. We are excited about the launch of our Zoom integration, which enables our partners to launch NFTs that connect directly with their communities without the need for user IDs and passwords.

Communities are the center of our universe and are the key to our success. NFTs and tokens can strengthen the relationship between consumers and their favorite brands. The consumer can connect directly to their favorite creators and brands by gaining access to special merchandise, events, and privileges, increasing brand loyalty and raising brand value. Ultimately, translating into the consumer spending more on brands’ products. The company’s already launched communities include Kathy Lee Gifford, Mamas and Papas’ Michelle Phillips, Aquarium of the Bay, Sam’s Anchor Café and Servino’s.

In the future, ViciCoin (VCNT) can be exchanged for access to special events, premium content and experiences, memberships, Non-Fungible Token (NFT) drops and sales, access to content creators, and physical products within the ViciNFT communities. As highlighted above, we are excited to launch our Zoom integration, which enables our partners to launch NFTs that connect directly with their communities without the need for user IDs and passwords. Our ViciCoin (VCNT) serves as fuel to increase the frequency and duration of the Zoom calls with their favorite personalities. As additional communities are added, we will expect demand for the ViciCoin (VCNT) to increase.
