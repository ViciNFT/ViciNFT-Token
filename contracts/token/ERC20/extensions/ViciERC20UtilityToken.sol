 * @title Vici ERC20 Utility Token
 * @notice (c) 2023 ViciNFT https://vicinft.com/
 * @author Josh Davis <josh.davis@vicinft.com>
 *
 * @notice This contract extends the behavior of the base Vici ERC20 contract by
 * providing a limitations to how airdropped tokens can be used by earmarking
 * tokens or by timelocking tokens.
 * @notice Earmarked tokens are airdropped to a user for the purpose of allowing
 * them to attend an event, purchase an NFT, or participate in other experiences
 * or utilities offered by ViciNFT.
 * @notice Time-locked tokens are airdropped to VIPs. Over time, time-locked
 * tokens become unlocked tokens according to a vesting schedule. Time-locked
 * tokens may also be spent in the same manner as earmarked tokens.
 * @notice If a user has earmarked tokens and time-locked tokens, the earmarked
 * tokens are spent first.
 * @dev Roles used by the access management are
 * - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: administers the other roles
 * - MODERATOR_ROLE_NAME: administers the banned role
 * - MINTER_ROLE_NAME: can mint/burn tokens
 * - AIRDROP_ROLE_NAME: can airdrop tokens and manage the list of addresses
 *   where earmarked tokens may be transferred.
 * - BANNED_ROLE: cannot send or receive tokens
